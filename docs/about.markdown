Hi, I'm Leif. I graduated with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo,
and am largely putting this to use, mostly in electronics, firmware development, and sensor analysis.

I'm interested in physics, statistics, and understanding our world better through data. If you've
got any questions or comments about any of my blog posts, feel free to reach out via email,
there should be a link at the bottom of this page. Some of the older posts on here are copied over
from my Medium account, but I'll be posting on here from now on.

Thanks for stopping by, and have a nice day!
